            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I wanted to pursue computer science due to my passion for coding. I personally think it’s very interesting and engaging, but I also just want to be able to live comfortably. I want it to work as a building block for me to be able to afford my hobbies, such as painting or playing music. I’d consider myself passionate towards what I love, such as coding and art.</p>
